accelerometer-simulator
=======================

This project has its root at [the correspondent google code project][1] and works with the latest version of the iOS SDK. It contains an iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch) application that transfers sensor data from the device to your computer using the UDP protocol.

A set of Objective-C classes replace the default UIAccelerometer of the iOS simulator to clone the received sensor data. Simply copy these files to your own iOS project to debug your app without having it installed on the real device.
